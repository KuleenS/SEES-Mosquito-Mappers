# Sentinel Data Attempt
Failed attempt to secure free satellite photos\
Resolution was too low\
Tried to use coordinates of area of interests provided to get square shape files \
Then used the shapefiles to query ESA Sentinel Two Photoes and convert them into tiffs\
The clipping using the shapefiles ultimately failed and used QGIS to help crop them
