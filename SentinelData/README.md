# Sentinel Data Attempt
Failed attempt to secure free satellite photos\
resolution was too low\
tried to use coordinates of area of interests provided to get square shape files \
then used the shapefiles to query ESA Sentinel Two Photoes and convert them into tiffs\
the clipping using the shapefiles ultimately failed and used QGIS to help crop them
